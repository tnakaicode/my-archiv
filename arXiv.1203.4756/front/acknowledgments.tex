    {\LARGE Acknowledgment}
  \end{center} 
  \vspace{2\baselineskip} I owe my deepest gratitude to my advisers:
  Prof. Irad Yavneh, and Dr. Michael Zibulevsky---without their help
  this work would not have been possible.

  I would like to thank Profs. Alfred Bruckstein, Avraham
  Sidi, and Marius Ungarish for our
  fruitful discussions and for their good company.

  I very much enjoyed our joint work with Prof. Mordechai Segev's
  group on sparsity-based subwavelength CDI. Special thanks to
  Profs. Yonina Eldar, and Mordechai Segev.

  Last, but not least, I am deeply indebted to my family and
  most of all to my wife Noa for their love and support.
