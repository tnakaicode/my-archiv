\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\name makes floating-point computations faster
  by choosing the right implementation
  of library functions like \F{exp} or \F{sin}.
\name uses a linear error model
  and integer linear programming
  to select the best implementations to use
  (from among standard mathematical libraries
  and generated implementations)
  for each use of a library function in a floating-point expression.
It then verifies the optimal configurations
  and presents the user with a speed-accuracy Pareto curve
  summarizing the available optimization options.
Across \nBenchmarks benchmarks,
  \name demonstrates speedups of up to \nBenchmarkLargeSpeedup,
  with speedups of \nBenchmarkSafeSpeedup available
  at negligible accuracy increases.
\name thus demonstrates the possibilities
  of a hitherto-underexplored avenue
  for floating-point program optimization.
